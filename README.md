# 🎮 NVIDIA CMP Unlock for Windows — CMP 70HX / 90HX

🇬🇧 English | [🇷🇺 Русский](README.ru.md)

Unlock the full computing and graphics power of the **NVIDIA CMP 70HX** (GA104, 8 GB, PCI ID `10de:248a`) or **CMP 90HX** (GA102, 10 GB, `10de:220d`) on any system with Windows — using a simple USB stick, an EFI bootloader, and **no reboots**.

The unlock runs **before any OS boots**, so Windows simply starts with the card already at full power.

> ℹ️ **Scope of this tree.** The source started out targeting the CMP 90HX. This
> port targets the **CMP 70HX**; the original 90HX is one command away
> (`TARGET=90HX bash build.sh`). Every card-specific number lives in a single
> `TARGET PROFILE` block at the top of `src/unlock_v2.c` and is *derived* from
> the framebuffer size. What is field-proven versus extrapolated is spelled out
> in [KNOWN-ISSUES.md](KNOWN-ISSUES.md) §13–16.

> ⚠️ **Honest expectations:** this is a mining card, and it is *not* a gaming
> GPU replacement — no display outputs, PCIe Gen1 ×16 in the current release,
> and gaming requires a community-patched driver (see below). Compute/AI is
> what it excels at after the unlock. Details in [KNOWN-ISSUES.md](KNOWN-ISSUES.md).

## What are the CMP 70HX / 90HX?

Both are GA10x dies sold by NVIDIA as **"mining-only" cards**. NVIDIA crippled them in firmware: CUDA compute and graphics features are disabled, and the card runs at a fraction of its real performance. The typical locked card delivers ~230 t/s on llama-bench; an unlocked 90HX delivers **~3700 t/s** (16× more).

This project re-enables the full die using an EFI application that runs from the bootable USB, before the OS loads. **It is open source** — see [`src/`](src/) and [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md).

## How the unlock works

1. **Preload.** The Windows boot manager (`bootmgfw.efi`) is read into RAM using raw block I/O and a built-in FAT32 parser. (No UEFI SimpleFileSystem is used — it hangs on some AMI boards.)
2. **Unlock.** A custom EFI application drives the GPU's SEC2 (Falcon) microcontroller through its secure boot sequence:
   - opens the memory-write-protection registers (WPR2),
   - loads a signed "canary" payload (V67) into the SEC2 booter,
   - opens the GPU's protected mode (PLM),
   - sets the compute selectors (SS0/SS1) and render masks.
3. **Reset.** A Function Level Reset (FLR) clears the latched protection registers while the compute selectors survive.
4. **Boot.** The app returns into the firmware without a POST, and Windows loads with the card already unlocked. **The system is never rebooted** — a POST would reset the GPU and drop the unlock.

The exploit itself: the NVIDIA-signed SEC2 booter has a stack-canary bug (Jon Pry, *"A Canary in the Crypto Mine"*). When it validates our oversized 64 KB "signature", execution runs into a ROP chain that performs arbitrary privileged register writes — including PLM open.

## What happens after you pick the USB in the boot menu (F12)

| Scenario | Result |
|---|---|
| **Windows boots** | The unlock ran, and Windows loads with the card at full power. ✅ |
| **Back to the boot menu** | If the chainload path can't proceed, the app returns to the firmware **without rebooting**, so you can pick any other boot device. The unlock state persists until the next full reboot (POST). |

## Test results

Verified on two real systems.

### llama-bench (CUDA, llama-2-7B Q4_0, `-ngl 99`)
```
| model        | size     | params | backend | ngl | test  | t/s              |
| llama 7B Q4_0| 3.56 GiB | 6.74 B | CUDA    | 99  | pp512 | 3705.40 ± 410.21 |
| llama 7B Q4_0| 3.56 GiB | 6.74 B | CUDA    | 99  | tg16  | 139.20 ± 2.56    |
```
Device 0: NVIDIA CMP 90HX, compute capability 8.6, VRAM: **10239 MiB** (full 10 GB).

### Gaming (with caveats!)

**Resident Evil Requiem** was tested and is playable when streamed via Moonlight (screenshot and HWiNFO log in [`tests/`](tests/)):

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| FPS | **31 – 63**, average **48.7** |
| GPU core clock | **1875 MHz** (full boost) |
| VRAM in use | up to **6.9 GB** of 10 GB |
| GPU power draw | up to **145 W** |
| GPU temperature | 44 – 57 °C |

That session used soldered capacitors (hardware mod) and PCIe Gen 1 ×16. Treat gaming as a bonus: no display outputs on the card, limited link bandwidth, and a patched driver is mandatory.

### Modified driver for rendering/gaming

The stock NVIDIA driver still blocks CMP cards from rendering (the restriction lives in the driver too, not only the firmware). To run graphics after the unlock, install a patched NVIDIA driver:

👉 **[https://github.com/dartraiden/NVIDIA-patcher](https://github.com/dartraiden/NVIDIA-patcher)**

## Requirements

- NVIDIA CMP 70HX (PCI ID `10de:248a`) **or** CMP 90HX (`10de:220d`)
- UEFI motherboard with a boot menu (F12)
- Windows installed on a GPT disk with an EFI System Partition
- **Secure Boot disabled** (the loader is unsigned)
- A USB stick (≥ 256 MB)
- `gsp_ga10x.bin` from the NVIDIA **610.43.03** driver package on the stick,
  next to `BOOTX64.EFI`

## Installation

1. Download the latest release image from the [Releases](https://github.com/WildFlash1st/cmp90hx-unlock-for-windows/releases) page.
2. Write the image to the USB stick with [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/), [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) (DD mode), or `dd`:
   ```bash
   dd if=<image>.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
   ```
   ⚠️ Double-check the device name — this wipes the target stick!
3. Verify the md5 against the one published with the release.
4. Reboot, press **F12** (or your board's boot-menu key), select the USB stick.
5. The unlock runs automatically — Windows loads at full power. No keys to press, nothing to configure.
6. *(For rendering/games only)* Install the patched NVIDIA driver from [NVIDIA-patcher](https://github.com/dartraiden/NVIDIA-patcher).

### Re-applying after a reboot

The unlock is **volatile**: a full reboot (POST) resets the GPU. To unlock again, simply boot from the USB stick again and let it chainload Windows. That's it.

## Building from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WildFlash1st/cmp90hx-unlock-for-windows
cd cmp90hx-unlock-for-windows/src
BLOBS=/path/to/blobs bash build.sh               # CMP 70HX (default)
TARGET=90HX BLOBS=/path/to/blobs bash build.sh   # original CMP 90HX
```

`TARGET` selects the card profile in the `TARGET PROFILE` block at the top of
`unlock_v2.c` (PCI ID, framebuffer size, and the derived FRTS/WPR2 geometry)
and links the matching FWSEC blob. The boot banner always names the card, its
PCI ID, FB size, FRTS offset and WPR2 pair — if that line does not say
`CMP 70HX (GA104) 10de:248A`, the wrong build is on the stick.

See **[BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md)** for prerequisites, blob provenance, the
objcopy section-list trap, and the USB-image recipe. Known limitations and
unsolved problems live in **[KNOWN-ISSUES.md](KNOWN-ISSUES.md)**.

## Repository layout

- `src/unlock_v2.c` — the entire EFI application (all build variants come from
  it); the `TARGET PROFILE` block at the top is the only place with
  card-specific constants
- `src/build.sh` — build script (gnu-efi, `TARGET=70HX|90HX`); `src/tools/` — firmware extraction helpers
- `docs/` — platform gotchas, register/geometry notes, Code 43 diagnostic report, blob patching procedure
- `tests/` — proof artifacts: game screenshot, HWiNFO log, llama-bench output
- `out/` — `.efi` builds produced here for both cards
- Release images are attached to the [Releases](https://github.com/WildFlash1st/cmp90hx-unlock-for-windows/releases) page
